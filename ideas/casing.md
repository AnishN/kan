Global constants are SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE

Primitive types:
* Lots of personal debate on this on
* In the end, threw out consistency (with other types) for convenience
* These types are **fundamental** and **trivially copyable**

Most (read: non-primitive) types are Pascal_Snake_Case
* Think this could be helpful when dealing w/ acronyms (e.g. `HTTP_Request`)
Function/lambda/block names are snake_case
Module names (including file names) are snake_case
